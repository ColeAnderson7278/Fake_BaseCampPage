                few students the basics of working in the programming field. It was started to help fill in the many job
                opening gaps that existed in the rural working environment of Mississippi and to do so in a short period
                of time.</p>

            <p class="item-title">The Goal</p>
            <hr style="font-weight:30px" />
            <p class="item-info">The final goal of Base Camp is not to make the students experts, but rather to make sure they are knowledgeable
                enough to get their foot in the door and build on what they are taught. This will then help lead them to
                the final goal which is getting a job at the end of the 11 months.</p>
